                  Mercury, Innermost planet of the solar system. Its average distance from the Sun is about 36 million
                  mi
                  (58 million km), but its highly elliptical orbit carries it 7.5 million mi (12 million km) nearer to
                  and
                  farther from the Sun. It is the smallest major planet, having a diameter of about 3,030 mi (4,880 km)
                  and a mass about one-eighteenth of Earth’s. With the shortest period of revolution (only 88 Earth
                  days)
                  and the highest average orbital speed (30 mi/sec [48 km/sec]) of any planet, it is aptly named after
                  the
                  Roman fleet-footed messenger god. It spins very slowly, making one complete rotation relative to the
                  stars every 59 Earth days, while its solar day (from one sunrise to the next) is 176 Earth days, owing
                  to its revolution around the Sun. Its surface is heavily cratered. Its most impressive feature is
                  perhaps the 960-mi (1,550-km) Caloris Basin, formed by a huge meteorite impact. Mercury also has steep
                  cliffs that extend for hundreds of miles. The discovery of a magnetic field in its vicinity suggests
                  it
                  has a large iron core, which would account for a mean density almost as high as Earth’s. Its
                  atmosphere
                  is negligible; its surface gravity, about one-third that of Earth’s, holds an exceedingly tenuous
                  layer
                  of gases. Temperatures at its surface change dramatically, ranging from a high that can exceed 800 °F
                  (425 °C) on the sunward side to a low of about −290 °F (−180 °C) at the end of its night.

                  Venus, Second major planet from the Sun. Named for the Roman goddess, Venus is, after the Moon, the
                  most
                  brilliant natural object in the night sky. Venus comes closer to Earth—about 26 million mi (42 million
                  km)—than any other planet. Its orbit around the Sun is nearly circular at a distance of about 67
                  million
                  mi (108 million km) and takes 225 days; its rotation, in retrograde motion, takes even longer (243
                  days). As viewed from Earth, Venus undergoes phase changes similar to the Moon’s, going through one
                  cycle of phases in 584 days. It is seen only near sunrise or sunset and has long been known as both
                  the
                  morning star and the evening star. Venus is a near twin of Earth in size and mass but is completely
                  enveloped by thick clouds of concentrated sulfuric acid droplets. Its surface gravity is about 90%
                  that
                  of Earth. Its atmosphere is over 96% carbon dioxide, with a pressure about 95 times Earth’s. The dense
                  atmosphere and thick cloud layers trap incoming solar energy so efficiently that Venus has the highest
                  surface temperature of any of the Sun’s planets, more than 860 °F (460 °C). Radar imaging indicates
                  that
                  the surface is dry and rocky, consisting mostly of gently rolling plains, broad depressions, and two
                  large elevated regions analogous to continents on Earth; Venus also has impact craters, extensive lava
                  fields, and massive shield volcanos. The interior is thought to be similar to that of Earth, with a
                  metal core, a dense rocky mantle, and a less-dense rocky crust. Unlike Earth, Venus has no intrinsic
                  magnetic field. <small>Summary taken from <a

                  Earth, Third planet in distance outward from the Sun. Believed to be about 4.56 billion years old, it
                  is
                  some 149,600,000 km (92,960,000 mi) from the Sun. It makes one revolution, or one complete orbit of
                  the
                  Sun, in about 365.25 days. As it revolves, it rotates on its axis once every 23 hours 56 minutes 4
                  seconds. The fifth largest planet of the solar system, it has an equatorial circumference of 40,076 km
                  (24,902 mi). Its total surface area is roughly 509,600,000 sq km (197,000,000 sq mi), of which about
                  71%
                  is water. Earth’s atmosphere consists of a mixture of gases, chiefly nitrogen and oxygen. Its only
                  natural satellite, the Moon, orbits the planet at a distance of about 384,400 km (238,900 mi). Earth’s
                  surface is traditionally subdivided into seven continental masses: Africa, Antarctica, Asia,
                  Australia,
                  Europe, North America, and South America. These continents are surrounded by four major bodies of
                  water:
                  the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. Broadly speaking, Earth’s interior consists of two
                  regions: a core composed largely of molten, iron-rich metallic alloy; and a rocky shell of silicate
                  minerals comprising both the mantle and crust (see also Moho; lithosphere). Fluid motions in the
                  electrically conductive outer core generate a magnetic field around Earth that is responsible for the
                  Van Allen radiation belts. According to the theory of plate tectonics, the crust is divided into a
                  number of large and small plates that float on and travel independently of the mantle. Plate motions
                  are
                  responsible for continental drift and seafloor spreading and for most volcanic and seismic activity on
                  Earth. <small>Summary taken from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/summary/Earth">Encyclopedia

                  Mars, Fourth planet from the Sun, named after the Roman god of war. Its mean distance from the Sun is
                  228 million km (142 million mi). Its day is 24 hours 37 minutes and its year about 687 Earth days. It
                  has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. Mars’s equatorial diameter is 3,396 km (2,110 mi), about half
                  that of Earth. Its mass is about one-tenth of Earth’s and its surface gravity about one-third as
                  strong.
                  No magnetic field has been detected on Mars, suggesting, as does its low density, the absence of a
                  substantial metallic core. Like Earth, it has seasons and an atmosphere, but its average daytime
                  surface
                  temperature is only −10 °F (−20 °C). Mars’s thin atmosphere is mainly carbon dioxide, with some
                  nitrogen
                  and argon and traces of water vapour. Spacecraft images show a cratered surface, with volcanoes, lava
                  plains, flood channels, and canyons, many large by Earth standards; Olympus Mons, for example, is the
                  largest known volcano in the solar system. Wind is an important element on Mars, sculpting features
                  such
                  as dunes and occasionally causing global dust storms. In the distant past Mars appears to have had a
                  denser, warmer atmosphere and much more water than at present. Images from the Mars Global Surveyor
                  spacecraft suggest that some liquid water may have flowed near the planet’s surface in relatively
                  recent
                  times. No life has been detected on the planet. <small>Summary taken from <a

                  Jupiter, Fifth planet from the Sun, the largest nonstellar object in the solar system. It has 318
                  times the mass and more than 1,400 times the volume of Earth. Its enormous mass gives it nearly 2.5
                  times the gravity of Earth (measured at the top of Jupiter’s atmosphere), and it exerts strong effects
                  on other members of the solar system. It is responsible for the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt and
                  changes in the orbits of comets; it may act as a “sweeper,” pulling in bodies that might otherwise
                  collide with other planets. Jupiter has more than 90 identified moons. It has a diffuse ring system
                  that was discovered in 1979 by the Voyager spacecraft. Jupiter is a gas giant, composed mainly of
                  hydrogen and helium in proportions near those of the Sun, which it orbits every 11.9 years at an
                  average distance of 483 million mi (778 million km). Its rapid rotation (9 hr 55.5 min) acts on
                  electric currents to give it the largest magnetic field of any of the planets and causes intense
                  storms, including one that has lasted hundreds of years (the Great Red Spot). Little is known of its
                  interior, but it is presumed to have a deep layer of metallic hydrogen and a dense core. Its central
                  temperature is estimated to be 45,000 °F (25,000 °C); it radiates twice as much heat as it receives
                  from the Sun, probably largely heat left over from its formation. <small>Summary

                  Saturn, Sixth planet from the Sun, named for the Roman god of sowing and seed. The second largest
                  nonstellar object in the solar system after Jupiter, it is about 95 times as massive as Earth and has
                  more than 700 times its volume. Saturn’s outer layers are gaseous, mainly hydrogen. Models of its
                  interior suggest a rock-and-ice core surrounded by a shallow layer of liquid metallic hydrogen encased
                  by an envelope of molecular hydrogen. Its mean density, about 70% that of water, is the lowest of any
                  known object in the solar system. Saturn has over 60 moons (including Titan, the largest) and an
                  extensive ring system, with several main sections visible from Earth with a telescope. Saturn’s rings
                  are made up of countless separate particles ranging mainly from inches to many feet in size but also
                  including dust in some regions. Water ice probably constitutes most of the ring material. Galileo
                  discerned the presence of the rings in 1610, though he mistook them for two other planets, owing to
                  the low resolution of his instrument. Saturn’s day is about 10.8 hours; its year is approximately 29.5
                  Earth years. Its rapid rotation, acting on electric currents in the core, generates a strong magnetic
                  field and large magnetosphere. Saturn’s fast spin also makes it the most flattened (oblate) of the
                  planets; its polar diameter of 67,560 mi (108,728 km) is 10% smaller than its equatorial diameter. Its
                  average distance from the Sun is 887 million mi (1.43 billion km). <small>Summary taken from <a

                  Uranus, Seventh planet from the Sun. It was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel (see Herschel
                  family) and named for the Greek god personifying heaven. A blue-green gas giant, it has almost 15
                  times the mass of Earth and over 50 times its volume. It is less dense than Earth; the gravity at the
                  top of its atmosphere is 11% weaker. Its equatorial diameter is 31,800 mi (51,100 km). Uranus has 10
                  sharply defined narrow, dark rings, with broad dust bands between them; the rings consist mainly of
                  boulder-size chunks of dark material. Uranus also has at least 27 moons (most named after
                  Shakespearean characters) and a magnetic field about as strong as Earth’s. The planet rotates once
                  every 17 hours around an axis that, unusually, is almost parallel to the ecliptic; from Earth it
                  appears to spin on its side. It takes 84 years to orbit the Sun, at a mean distance of 1.78 billion mi
                  (2.87 billion km). It has no solid surface; its fluid interior is thought to consist of a mixture of
                  rock, ices, and gas, with little or no rocky core. Its upper atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium;
                  the blue-green colour comes from absorption of red light by the small amount of methane present.

                  Neptune, Eighth planet from the Sun, discovered in 1846 and named for the Roman god of the sea. It has
                  an average distance from the Sun of 2.8 billion mi (4.5 billion km), taking nearly 164 years to
                  complete one orbit and rotating every 16.11 hours. Neptune has more than 17 times Earth’s mass, 58
                  times its volume, and 12% stronger gravity at the top of its atmosphere. It has an equatorial diameter
                  of 30,775 mi (49,528 km). Neptune consists largely of hydrogen and helium. It has no solid surface;
                  its interior is believed to consist of a fluid mixture of rock, ices, and gas. Its atmosphere contains
                  substantial amounts of methane gas, whose absorption of red light causes Neptune’s deep blue-green
                  colour. The Voyager 2 space probe in 1989 discovered winds of over 1,570 mi/hour (700 m/second), the
                  fastest known for any of the Sun’s planets, and dark spots that appear to be storms similar to
                  Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. Neptune receives little solar radiation, but it radiates substantially more
                  energy than it receives, which indicates an internal heat source. Neptune’s weak magnetic field traps
                  charged particles in a belt around the planet. Neptune has a system of rings, made up largely of
                  dust-size particles, and at least 13 moons; the largest is Triton, almost as big as Earth’s Moon.
